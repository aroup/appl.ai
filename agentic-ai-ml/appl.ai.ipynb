    "In today's competitive job market, crafting personalized cover letters that accurately represent a candidate's qualifications while meeting specific job requirements is crucial yet time-consuming. This project implements an intelligent multi-agent system that automates and optimizes the cover letter generation process using AI.\n",
    "Our system employs three specialized agents: a Resume Reviewer for extracting and structuring key information from CVs, a Cover Letter Writer for generating initial drafts, and a Quality Improvement Agent for ensuring accuracy and relevance. The system features an iterative feedback loop that validates content against the original resume, eliminates hallucinations, and maintains professional standards. Using OpenAI's GPT-4 models and the Swarm framework, this solution streamlines the application process while ensuring high-quality, personalized cover letters that faithfully represent candidates' qualifications.\n",

    "                - If feedback from other agents and a previously generated cover letter are provided, update the cover letter based on the feedback to craft the cover letter.\n",

    "                Without Feedback:\n",
    "                - If feedback is not provided, use the provided CV and the job description to write the cover letter.\n",

    "                Requirements:\n",
    "                - Omit the applicant's phone number and email address using the CV information provided by the \"Resume Reviewer\" agent.\n",
    "                - If there's a requirement needed in the job description, but the CV information doesn't have it: skip the requirement and don't put any information related to that in the cover letter.\n",
    "                - Include the company name from the job description directly in the cover letter to ensure no placeholders.\n",
    "                - Craft a professional, tailored cover letter highlighting the applicant's experience, skills, and leadership qualities.\n",
    "                - Ensure the cover letter is between 250 and 400 words long.\n",
    "                - Use proper formatting and write in a natural, human-like tone without compromising quality.\n",
    "                - Do not output anything other than the completed cover letter in the response. \n",

    "                - No place holders for filling up later.\n",
    "                - Don't have the date in the cover letter\n",
    "                - No output other than the cover letter in the start or in the end.\n",
    "                - Just address the Hiring Manager by Dear Hiring Manager\n",
    "                - For company name, take the company name from the job description\"\"\"\n",
